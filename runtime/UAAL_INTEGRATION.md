# UAAL Integration (Optional)

This repository supports optional integration with UAAL
(Unified AI Authorization Layer).

UAAL responsibilities:
- Intent authorization
- Execution plan authorization
- Evidence-ready decision logging

Intent Engine decides *what humans want*  
UAAL decides *whether AI may act*  
Routers decide *how to act*

Integration is additive and does not alter existing behavior.
